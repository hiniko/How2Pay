## Payment Range Planning

### Overview
Every schedule starts with a payment summary showing min/max amounts each payee needs to contribute across the projection period, helping with budget planning and payment management.

### What It Shows
```
ðŸ’° Payment Planning
Alice: Â£649.97 - Â£677.47 (min: March 2024, max: January 2024)
Bob: Â£561.65 - Â£589.15 (min: March 2024, max: January 2024)
Charlie: Â£332.00 (consistent)
```

**For each payee:**
- **Minimum amount**: Lowest monthly contribution needed
- **Maximum amount**: Highest monthly contribution needed  
- **Min months**: When minimum payments occur 
- **Max months**: When maximum payments occur 
- **Consistent**: Shows when amounts are the same every month

### Use Cases

**Budget Planning**: Know your highest and lowest payment months to plan savings and expenses.

**Payment Management**: Prepare for higher payment periods by saving during lower ones.

**Income Timing**: Align income sources with higher payment requirements.

**Financial Communication**: Share payment expectations with household members upfront.

### Technical Details
- Calculations include all active bills for each payee
- Takes into account payee start dates and bill end dates
- Considers custom bill sharing percentages
- Updates automatically when bill amounts or schedules change

## Price History & Bill Increases

### Overview
Track bill increases over time with automatic scheduling. Instead of single amounts, bills can have multiple price periods with different amounts and effective dates.

### Configuration Format
```yaml
bills:
  - name: "Rent"
    price_history:
      - amount: 1200.0
        start_date: "2024-01-01"
        recurrence:
          kind: "calendar"
          interval: "monthly"
          start: "2024-01-01"
      - amount: 1350.0  # 12.5% increase
        start_date: "2024-07-01"
        recurrence:
          kind: "calendar"
          interval: "monthly"
          start: "2024-07-01"
      - amount: 1500.0  # Another increase
        start_date: "2025-01-01"
        recurrence:
          kind: "calendar"
          interval: "monthly"
          start: "2025-01-01"
```

### How It Works
1. **Sorted by Date**: Price entries are automatically sorted by start_date
2. **Automatic Selection**: Scheduler picks the appropriate price for each payment date
3. **Seamless Transitions**: Bills automatically use new amounts starting from effective dates
4. **Future Planning**: Project costs with known future increases

### Use Cases

**Rent Increases**: Model annual rent increases with specific effective dates.

**Utility Rate Changes**: Handle seasonal pricing or rate adjustments.

**Subscription Changes**: Track streaming service or software price changes.

**Contract Renewals**: Plan for known price changes at contract renewal dates.

### Example Scenario
With the rent example above:
- **Jan-Jun 2024**: Â£1,200/month
- **Jul-Dec 2024**: Â£1,350/month  
- **Jan+ 2025**: Â£1,500/month

The payment planning summary will reflect these changes, showing different amounts for different months.

### Backward Compatibility
Existing bills with single `amount` and `recurrence` fields automatically convert to price_history format for seamless upgrades.

## Custom Bill Splitting

### Overview
Control exactly how bills are split between payees with custom percentages, supporting complex household arrangements.

### Equal Splitting (Default)
Without custom percentages, bills split equally among all active payees:
```yaml
bills:
  - name: "Electricity"
    amount: 120.0
    # Splits equally: 3 payees = Â£40 each
```

### Custom Percentages
Specify exact contributions per payee:
```yaml
bills:
  - name: "Groceries"
    amount: 200.0
    share:
      - payee: "Alice"
        percentage: 25.0  # Â£50
      - payee: "Bob"  
        percentage: 35.0  # Â£70
      - payee: "Charlie"
        percentage: 40.0  # Â£80
    # Total must equal 100%
```

### Single Payer Bills
Have one person pay specific bills:
```yaml
bills:
  - name: "Netflix"
    amount: 12.99
    share:
      - payee: "Bob"
        percentage: 100.0  # Bob pays all
```

### Mixed Scenarios
Some bills equal split, others custom:
```yaml
bills:
  - name: "Rent"
    amount: 1500.0
    # Equal split: Â£500 each
    
  - name: "Groceries"
    amount: 300.0
    share:
      - payee: "Alice"
        percentage: 30.0  # Â£90
      - payee: "Bob"
        percentage: 70.0  # Â£210
    # Charlie pays nothing for groceries
    
  - name: "Internet"  
    amount: 50.0
    # Equal split: Â£16.67 each
```

### Validation Rules
- Percentages must be between 0-100
- All percentages for a bill must total exactly 100%
- Payee names must match existing payees
- Missing payees get 0% (don't contribute to that bill)

### Use Cases

**Different Income Levels**: Higher earners pay more of shared expenses.

**Usage-Based Splitting**: Split utilities based on actual usage patterns.

**Personal vs Shared**: Some expenses (Netflix) paid by one person, others shared.

**Temporary Arrangements**: Custom splits during transition periods.

## Payee Start Dates

### Overview
Handle people joining households mid-year with start dates that control when they begin contributing to bills.

### Configuration
```yaml
payees:
  - name: "Alice"
    # No start_date = active from beginning
    
  - name: "Bob"
    start_date: "2024-06-01"  # Starts contributing June 1st
    
  - name: "Charlie"  
    start_date: "2024-09-15"  # Starts mid-September
```

### How It Works
- **Before Start Date**: Payee appears in schedules but shows "-" for payments
- **After Start Date**: Payee becomes active and contributes to bill calculations
- **Equal Split Impact**: Only active payees count for equal splitting
- **Custom Splits**: Inactive payees with custom percentages still show 0 contribution

### Example Impact
For a Â£300 bill with equal splitting:

**Before Charlie joins (2 active payees):**
- Alice: Â£150
- Bob: Â£150  
- Charlie: - (not active)

**After Charlie joins (3 active payees):**
- Alice: Â£100
- Bob: Â£100
- Charlie: Â£100

### Use Cases

**New Roommates**: Someone moving in mid-lease period.

**Seasonal Residents**: Students home for summer/winter breaks.

**Relationship Changes**: Partners moving in together.

**Trial Periods**: Temporary arrangements before permanent commitments.

### Display Behavior
- **TUI**: Shows "-" for inactive payees in payment columns
- **PDF**: Same behavior, clearly indicating non-active status
- **Payment Summary**: Only includes months when payee is active

---

## Income Stream Management

### Overview
Payees can have multiple income sources with different schedules, amounts, and contribution percentages.

### Multiple Income Streams
```yaml
payees:
  - name: "Alice"
    pay_schedules:
      - description: "Salary"
        recurrence:
          kind: "calendar"
          interval: "monthly"
          start: "2024-01-28"
          
      - description: "Freelance"
        recurrence:
          kind: "calendar"  
          interval: "monthly"
          start: "2024-01-15"
          end: "2024-06-15"  # Temporary income
        contribution_percentage: 100.0  # All goes to bills
```

### Income Stream Types

**Regular Salary**: Monthly/weekly consistent amounts

**Freelance/Contract**: Variable or temporary income with end dates

**Part-time Work**: Weekly or bi-weekly smaller amounts

**Benefits/Stipends**: Monthly government or institutional payments

**Investment Income**: Quarterly dividends or rental income

### Custom Contribution Percentages
Control what percentage of each income stream goes to bills:

```yaml
pay_schedules:
  - amount: 3000.0
    description: "Salary" 
    # No percentage = uses proportional calculation
    
  - amount: 500.0
    description: "Side Business"
    contribution_percentage: 100.0  # All goes to bills
    
  - amount: 200.0
    description: "Investments"
    contribution_percentage: 0.0    # None goes to bills
```

### Contribution Calculation
- **No percentage**: Income contributes proportionally to total household needs
- **Custom percentage**: Fixed percentage regardless of household needs
- **100% streams**: All income dedicated to bills (good for temporary income)
- **0% streams**: Personal income not used for shared expenses

### Display Features
- **Income stream names** in column headers
- **Payment dates** for each stream
- **Zero contributions** hidden by default (use `--show-zero` to display)
- **Multiple streams** per payee clearly separated

- **High Contrast**: Colors chosen for readability and distinction
- **WCAG Compliance**: 4.5:1 contrast ratio for accessibility

### Color Applications

**Terminal (TUI)**: Rich markup colors for payee names and headers

**PDF Export**: Hex colors for professional appearance  

**HTML Generation**: CSS-compatible color values

### Payee Color Examples
```
Payee 1: #E74C3C (Red)
Payee 2: #3498DB (Blue)  
Payee 3: #2ECC71 (Green)
Payee 4: #F39C12 (Orange)
Payee 5: #9B59B6 (Purple)
```

### Benefits
- **Quick Identification**: Instantly recognize payee data across complex tables
- **Visual Consistency**: Same colors in TUI, PDF, and HTML outputs
